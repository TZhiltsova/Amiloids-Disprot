# Amiloids-Disprot
Repository for working on project by finding amiloid-forming peptides in Disprot DB

# The main goal of the project 

##### to find amiloid forming sequences in peptides which is represent in *Disprot DB*

## Tasks

- To find the way to get sequences no longer then 1000 residuce out of Disprot DB
- To find in this sequences amiloid-forming regions (this date may be obtained from Waltz DB)
- To create final file with amiloid-forming peptides
